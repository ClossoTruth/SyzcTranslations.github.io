**Teaser:**

Little Ye Tian quickly checked everything. 204 gold, 45 silver, 8 gold bars, 1 gold ingot, precious gems, a 16.531 centimeter golden monstrous bird statue, a golden ring. She lamented, her father was probably the richest man in the game. The kind that crushed all competition. Most people would only have silver coins. Finally Ye Cang also gave her the federal dollars. 14 million federal dollars. About 3 million of which was Lil’Dino’s remodelling funds. Having now grasped their financial situation, she started to carefully make plans, though it only took a second. 

FrozenCloud was still trying to figure out how Lin Le got 3 from 100 x 100. Ye Cang chopped up the surrounding rats and threw them into the cart. Then he brought everyone to go through the cave that that monster who attacked Lele had come from.
