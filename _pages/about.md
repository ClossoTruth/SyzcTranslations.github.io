# About Me

I'm a newbie translator who speak chinese but can't read it without alot of help from a dictionary. Not that good at english either... But I'm sure that translating these novels will help me improve both of these things!

Status: Addicted to translating.

# About This Website

Still a work in progress.

is a static site that I threw together in two days so i could quickly get my translations to you all. As a programmer by trade, I should really add more features to it and move away from a static site... but I would rather spend that time reading/translating more.

I copied some code from some of [Tania Rascia's][tania] tutorials to get this set up more quickly. The image at the header (for those not on mobile) is drawn by [XiaoBai][xiaobai]. I absolutely love her drawings ever since i bought them one time at an anime convention.
